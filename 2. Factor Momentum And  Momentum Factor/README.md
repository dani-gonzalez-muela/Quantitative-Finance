# Factor Momentum and the Momentum Factor: A European Approach


---

## Project Focus
The project investigates **momentum** as a persistent market anomaly that challenges the Efficient Market Hypothesis by showing that past returns can predict future returns. While momentum has traditionally been studied at the **individual stock level**, recent research by **Ehsani and Linnainmaa (2022)** demonstrates that it also operates at the **factor level**, where factors explain cross-sectional stock returns.  

This study extends their **U.S.-focused findings to the European market**, which differs in regulatory, structural, and data characteristics. Using **econometric techniques** and **novel datasets**, the research evaluates whether **factor momentum** patterns persist in Europe, their relationship with **individual stock momentum**, and their implications for **asset pricing** and **risk management**.  

A new factor—**FMOM (Factor Momentum)**—is constructed and tested, capturing momentum **within factors themselves**, rather than solely at the stock level.

## Key Components

### 1. Theoretical Framework
- Overview of **asset pricing models** and the **construction of systematic factors**.  
- Discussion of momentum’s theoretical foundations and its role as a market anomaly.  

### 2. Empirical Analysis
- Tests for **factor autocorrelation** and **momentum profitability** in European data.  
- Examination of **FMOM’s** interaction with **principal components (PCs)** and **covariance structures**.  
- Comparison between **factor-level** and **stock-level** momentum performance.

### 3. Results and Insights
- Evidence of factor momentum patterns in Europe, though generally **weaker than in U.S. markets**.  
- Stronger factor momentum observed in specific periods and sectors, influenced by sample coverage and structural differences.  
- The **FMOM** factor contributes to explaining traditional momentum returns, providing a **complementary perspective** on return predictability.

### 4. Implications and Contributions
- Extends recent literature by demonstrating that **factor momentum** persists beyond the U.S. market context.  
- Highlights the importance of **systematic drivers** behind momentum returns and their potential applications in **portfolio construction** and **risk management**.  
- Opens pathways for future research on **multi-factor dynamics**, **European market structure**, and **cross-market momentum effects**.
