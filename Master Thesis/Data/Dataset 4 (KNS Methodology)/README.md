Dataset 4 consists of 154 characteristic-based factors derived from
the stock characteristics in Dataset 3. It covers the period from August 1990 to
December 2023, resulting in a dataset of 401 rows and 154 columns. It follows the
same format as Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 but with one fewer observation. Each cell
contains the monthly excess return (in percentage) of one of the 154 factors, where
the rows represent the time period, and the columns correspond to the factors.

In order to create this Dataset one must download Dataset 3 first, and then run
the python code provided for this project.
